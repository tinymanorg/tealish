========

The `examples directory <https://github.com/tinymanorg/tealish/tree/main/examples>`_ of the repo contains various examples of apps written in Tealish.

A Tealish port of the auction contract from the `Algorand docs <https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/dapps/pyteal/#the-smart-contract>`_ is reproduced below.
